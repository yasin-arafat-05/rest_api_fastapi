Sure, I'll explain in simpler English:

DevOps is like a teamwork approach for making computer programs. It has different steps:

1. **Plan:**
   - **Tools:** Jira, Trello, Asana, GitLab Issues, GitHub Projects
   - **What:** Plan what work needs to be done, set schedules, and decide goals. Use tools to organize tasks.

2. **Code:**
   - **Tools:** Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
   - **What:** Write computer code and save it using tools like Git. Platforms like GitHub help manage code.

3. **Build:**
   - **Tools:** Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI
   - **What:** Build and test the code automatically whenever there are changes. This helps catch problems early.

4. **Test:**
   - **Tools:** Selenium, JUnit, Jira, TestRail
   - **What:** Use tools to check if the code works correctly. It includes different types of tests.

5. **Package:**
   - **Tools:** Docker, JFrog Artifactory, Nexus Repository
   - **What:** Get the code ready to run by putting it in containers. Docker is a common tool for this.

6. **Release:**
   - **Tools:** Ansible, Terraform, Helm, AWS CloudFormation
   - **What:** Use tools to send the code to where it needs to go. This includes setting up the environment.

7. **Deploy:**
   - **Tools:** Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, OpenShift
   - **What:** Manage and scale the running code in production. Kubernetes is one tool for this.

8. **Operate:**
   - **Tools:** Prometheus, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Grafana
   - **What:** Keep an eye on how well the code and systems are working. Use tools to monitor and fix issues.

9. **Monitor:**
   - **Tools:** Nagios, Datadog, New Relic
   - **What:** Keep watching the system and get alerts if something goes wrong. This helps to fix problems quickly.

10. **Feedback:**
    - **Tools:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty
    - **What:** Communicate with the team and get alerts about issues. This helps everyone stay informed.

Remember, DevOps is about working together, using tools to make things easier, and always trying to make things better.
